    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "Multifractal analysis is a tool to analyse *scale invariant* data, that is, signals for which no single scale play a characteristic role. It has been applied to the study of several kinds of data, such as hydrodynamic turbulence, human heart beat rhythms, texture image analysis, magnetoencephalography signals, among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scale invariance is related to *power-laws*. Let's consider, for instance, a signal whose power spectral density (PSD) is $\\Gamma(\\nu) \\approx C |\\nu|^{-\\gamma} $ in low frequencies, where $\\nu$ is the frequency and $C$ and $\\gamma$ are constants. For a scaling factor $a$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Gamma(a\\nu) \\approx a^{-\\gamma}C |\\nu|^{-\\gamma} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a scaled version of the power spectrum has the same shape as the original spectrum, which implies the absence of a characteristic frequency in the signal. In this case, the scale invariance is characterized by the exponent $\\gamma$. Thus, in several applications, scale invariance has been defined and analyzed through the power law behavior of power spectrum estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach has limitations. For non-stationary processes, defining and interpreting a power spectral density is not trivial; and the behaviour more complex signals or systems cannot be well characterized by a single scale invariance coefficient $\\gamma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how multifractal analysis extends this approach to non-stationary and more complex signals.  \n",
